# stopwatch-web-application

This project is a fully functional and interactive Stopwatch Web Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application is designed to allow users to accurately measure and track elapsed time with essential features such as Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap Time Recording. One of the key highlights of this project is the user-friendly interface with a modern, dark-themed layout and a custom background image (time.JPEG) that enhances visual appeal. The application includes animated lap entries to make each recorded lap visually noticeable and adds an interactive touch by playing a click sound whenever a lap is saved. Furthermore, the app is fully responsive, featuring a mobile-friendly hamburger navigation menu for an optimized user experience across all devices. All core functionalities are handled using clean and efficient JavaScript code with real-time updates driven by setInterval() and Date.now(). The UI components are styled using CSS, incorporating smooth transitions, hover effects, and media queries to maintain layout integrity on smaller screens. This project not only demonstrates practical implementation of timing logic but also showcases how thoughtful design and interactive elements can elevate the user experience. It serves as a great example of combining front-end development skills into a cohesive, real-world application.
